This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  If the app is opened from a deep link that includes query parameters, and those parameters contain special characters (like '+' or '%'),  the `Linking.getInitialURL()` function may return `null` or an incomplete URL, causing the app to fail to navigate correctly.  This issue is not consistently reproducible, depending on the device and OS version.
